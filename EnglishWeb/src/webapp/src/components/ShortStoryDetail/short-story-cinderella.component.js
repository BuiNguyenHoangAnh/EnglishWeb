                    Once upon a time there was a kind and beautiful girl, whose name was Cinderella.
                    She lived with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters where she was treated as a
                    servant and spent her days cleaning, tidying and waiting on them hand and foot.
                    Despite their cruelty, Cinderella would always remember her mother’s words:
                    ‘Have courage and be kind.’
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    One day an invitation to a royal ball arrived. The Prince was looking for a
                    bride and everyone in the kingdom was invited. Her stepmother immediately
                    ordered new gowns to be made for herself and her daughters. Cinderella worked
                    day and night to prepare the new dresses in time.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    On the day of the ball, as they were preparing to leave, Cinderella came down
                    the stairs in a dress she had made for herself. Her stepmother and stepsisters
                    were so angry to see her looking so beautiful they tore up the dress and left
                    without her.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Left alone, Cinderella began to cry when all of a sudden her Fairy Godmother
                    appeared.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    “Do not cry my child, you shall go to the ball!” she said.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    “But I do not have a dress to wear.” cried Cinderella. Her Fairy Godmother waved
                    her magic wand and at once Cinderella’s rags turned into a beautiful new ball
                    gown.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then her Fairy Godmother found six mice playing in the pumpkin patch.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    She touched them with her magic wand and the pumpkin turned into a beautiful
                    coach and the mice into four white horses and two coachmen.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When everything was ready, Cinderella waved goodbye to her fairy godmother who
                    said, “The magic will only last until midnight. You must reach home by then.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When she entered the ballroom, the guests were struck by her beauty and her
                    stepmother and stepsisters did not know who she was. The prince asked Cinderella
                    to dance and she was overjoyed.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Prince and Cinderella danced all evening until Cinderella noticed the clock
                    approaching midnight and she remembered her godmother’s words. “I must go” she
                    told the Prince as she fled from the ballroom.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As she ran down the steps of the palace, one of her glass slippers fell off, but
                    Cinderella did not stop to pick it up. She returned home just as the clock
                    struck twelve.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Her coach turned back into a pumpkin, her horses became mice and she was wearing
                    rags once more. Her stepmother and stepsisters arrived home shortly afterwards
                    and were full of talk of the beautiful girl who had danced all night with the
                    prince.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The prince had fallen in love with Cinderella the moment he saw her, but he did
                    not even know her name. He picked up her glass slipper from the steps and
                    declared “I will marry the girl whose foot fits this slipper.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The prince and his servants took the glass slipper to every house in the
                    Kingdom, but it did not fit any of the women who tried it on.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Cinderella’s stepsisters tried to squeeze their large feet into the dainty shoe,
                    but the servant was afraid it might break. Cinderella’s stepmother would not let
                    her try on the slipper, but the prince said “Wait! Let her try it!”.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The slipper fit Cinderella’s foot perfectly and the Prince realised this was the
                    beautiful girl he had danced with at the ball.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Prince had found the girl he was looking for. They were married and both
                    lived happily ever after.

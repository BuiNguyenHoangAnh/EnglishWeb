                    It is a beautiful summer day. The sun shines warmly on an old house near a
                    river. Behind the house a mother duck is sitting on ten eggs. "Tchick." One by
                    one all the eggs break open.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    All except one. This one is the biggest egg of all.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Mother duck sits and sits on the big egg. At last it breaks open, "Tchick,
                    tchick!"
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Out jumps the last baby duck. It looks big and strong. It is grey and ugly.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The next day mother duck takes all her little ducks to the river. She jumps into
                    it. All her baby ducks jump in. The big ugly duckling jumps in too.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>They all swim and play together. The ugly duckling swims better than all
                        the other ducklings.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    - Quack, quack! Come with me to the farm yard! - says mother duck to her baby
                    ducks and they all follow her there.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>The farm yard is very noisy. The poor duckling is so unhappy there. The
                        hens peck him, the rooster flies at him, the ducks bite him, the farmer kicks
                        him.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    At last one day he runs away. He comes to a river. He sees many beautiful big
                    birds swimming there. Their feathers are so white, their necks so long, their
                    wings so pretty. The little duckling looks and looks at them. He wants to be
                    with them. He wants to stay and watch them. He knows they are swans. Oh, how he
                    wants to be beautiful like them.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now it is winter. Everything is white with snow. The river is covered with ice.
                    The ugly duckling is very cold and unhappy. Spring comes once again. The sun
                    shines warmly. Everything is fresh and green.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    One morning the ugly duckling sees the beautiful swans again. He knows them. He
                    wants so much to swim with them in the river. But he is afraid of them. He wants
                    to die. So he runs into the river. He looks into the water. There in the water
                    he sees a beautiful swan. It is he! He is no more an ugly duckling. He is a
                    beautiful white swan.

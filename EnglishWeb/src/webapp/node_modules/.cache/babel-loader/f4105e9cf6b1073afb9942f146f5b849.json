The prince asked Cinderella\r\n                    to dance and she was overjoyed.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The Prince and Cinderella danced all evening until Cinderella noticed the clock\r\n                    approaching midnight and she remembered her godmother’s words. “I must go” she\r\n                    told the Prince as she fled from the ballroom.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    As she ran down the steps of the palace, one of her glass slippers fell off, but\r\n                    Cinderella did not stop to pick it up. She returned home just as the clock\r\n                    struck twelve.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    Her coach turned back into a pumpkin, her horses became mice and she was wearing\r\n                    rags once more. Her stepmother and stepsisters arrived home shortly afterwards\r\n                    and were full of talk of the beautiful girl who had danced all night with the\r\n                    prince.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The prince had fallen in love with Cinderella the moment he saw her, but he did\r\n                    not even know her name. He picked up her glass slipper from the steps and\r\n                    declared “I will marry the girl whose foot fits this slipper.”\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The prince and his servants took the glass slipper to every house in the\r\n                    Kingdom, but it did not fit any of the women who tried it on.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    Cinderella’s stepsisters tried to squeeze their large feet into the dainty shoe,\r\n                    but the servant was afraid it might break. Cinderella’s stepmother would not let\r\n                    her try on the slipper, but the prince said “Wait! Let her try it!”.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The slipper fit Cinderella’s foot perfectly and the Prince realised this was the\r\n                    beautiful girl he had danced with at the ball.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    The Prince had found the girl he was looking for.
